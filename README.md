# Developer Test

### Overview

The purpose of this test is to not only gauge the capabilities of potential applicants, but to also get an idea of their approach to development and problem-solving.

To complete this test, clone (don't fork) the repository to your own public Git repo, complete the task, and then email the URL of your repo to phil@iseekplant.com.au.  Include any instructions of any necessary steps to get your code working in the README file (e.g. installing Composer dependencies).

Whilst there is no time limit, this test is not intended to take a long time to complete so use your judgement.

## The Task

At iSeekplant we work hard and play hard, and now it's time for some well-deserved downtime.  We're planning a little holiday, but want to ensure that we get the best rate for our hotel of choice.  We're fairly flexible with our travel plans, so we need you to help us to decide when to travel.

You are required to write the code necessary to query the API for [TheBookingButton](http://www.siteminder.com/the-booking-button/) to retrieve the best room rates for a hotel.

The full documentation for TheBookingButton rates API can be found at https://help.thebookingbutton.com/hc/en-us/articles/203326314-TheBookingButton-Rates-API

For the sake of this exercise use the channel code `bbdemo` when retrieving rates.  The region for this property is APAC.

Your solution must:
* Display the best **available** rate for each room type over the coming 21 days
* Display when the above best rate is for
* Display the **overall** best rate for the hotel - including date and room type

Display the results in the web browser in an easy-to-read format - styling and layout is at your discretion.

## Restrictions

The backend component of your solution **must** be written in PHP.  You may support whatever version(s) of PHP that you wish, but you must include details of those requirements in your README file.

You may use whatever tools and/or frameworks you wish to get the job done.

Your code must be fully commented to explain what is happening.

## Extra Credit

If you have time and are inspired to delve a little further into this, feel free to look at any of the below:
* Expand the search window to capture the best rate over the next **60 days**.
* We know that we want to stay for three nights at this hotel - update your code to calculate the best available rates for three consecutive nights.

If you attempt any of these, make a note in your README file.

## Any questions?

Create a new issue with your query and we will answer you as soon as possible.

### Good luck!
